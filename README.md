Hello, I am Vili. But you may also call me Yusuke. I go by He/Him/His/Himself or They/Them/Their/Themself pronouns. I am not an introject. However, I do affiliate myself with the character, Yusuke Kitagawa from Persona 5. Please do not assume that I need mental help, or anything of the sort. I find it very insulting.

**If this account is linked to a skin from WHB it is most likely Shun, our host. He is very kind, I do reccomend conversing with him.**

**Do not assume I am a legal adult physically because I speak like I do. Remember that I am apart of a system full of alters who are a majority of minors. Just because I am ageless, but not a minor, does not mean you can sexualize me.**
And yes, this is targeted.
